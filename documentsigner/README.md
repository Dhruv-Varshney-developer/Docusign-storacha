# 🖋️ DocumentSigner on Storacha – UCAN-based Document Signing

**DocumentSigner on Storacha** is a full-stack demo application showcasing real-world UCAN (User Controlled Authorization Networks) capabilities using [Storacha](https://storacha.network/) for decentralized file storage and permission delegation.

This project enables secure, permissioned workflows for uploading, viewing, and signing PDF documents, using UCANs for cryptographically-verifiable, time-bound, and role-specific access control.

## Overview

This application demonstrates how UCANs can replace traditional access control systems by delegating authority directly between users via cryptographically signed tokens. The project uses **Storacha** to store documents on IPFS, and manages sequential signing flows between users like `uploader`, `signer1`, and `signer2`.

## UCAN Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept                      | Description                                                                | Implementation |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Capability Delegation**    | UCANs define what a recipient *can* do (`can`) with what resource (`with`) | [UCANGeneration.md](./docs/UCANGeneration.md) |
| **Proof Chains**             | Each UCAN is verifiable via a chain of signed delegations                  | [decodeUCAN.md](./docs/decodeUCAN.md) |
| **Time-Bound Access**        | UCANs include `nbf` (not-before) and `exp` (expiration) timestamps         | [UCANGeneration.md](./docs/UCANGeneration.md) |
| **Revocation-by-expiry**     | Signing permission automatically invalidated after use or timeout          | [signature.md](./docs/signature.md) |
| **Sequential Authorization** | Signer1 → Signer2 enforced by chaining and timing of UCANs                 | [track.md](./docs/track.md) |
| **Verification**             | Validations for format, audience, and expiration built into viewer         | [decodeUCAN.md](./docs/decodeUCAN.md) |

## Architecture & Workflow

### High-Level Flow

1. **Document Upload** - PDF uploaded to Storacha, stored on IPFS with unique CID
2. **UCAN Delegation** - Document owner creates time-bound signing permissions for authorized parties
3. **IPNS Publishing** - Document metadata published to persistent IPNS name for tracking
4. **Sequential Signing** - Authorized signers complete signatures within their time windows
5. **Progress Tracking** - Real-time monitoring of signing completion status
6. **Document Versioning** - Each signature creates new IPFS version, IPNS updated automatically

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Storage**: Storacha (Web3.Storage) for IPFS integration
- **Authorization**: UCAN delegation chains with time-based constraints
- **Naming**: IPNS for persistent, updatable document links
- **Signatures**: HTML5 Canvas with cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)

## Getting Started

### 🧩 Prerequisites

* Node.js ≥ 18
* Yarn or npm
* Git

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhruv-Varshney-developer/DocumentSigner-storacha
cd DocumentSigner
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

#### 3. Set up Web3.Storage credentials

Install the storacha CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @web3-storage/w3cli
```

Then follow the steps below to generate and link your credentials:

```bash
# Log in to storacha
w3 login your@email.com

# List spaces
w3 space ls

# Select space
w3 space use <space_did>

# Create agent key (copy the output)
w3 key create

# Create a delegation and copy the output
w3 delegation create <the_did_from_previous_step> --base64

# Creates a UCAN delegation from the w3cli agent to the agent we generated above (copy output or save in proof.txt)
w3 delegation create <the_did_from_key_create> --base64 >> proof.txt
```
> **Note**: *A Space DID represents the user's data container, while an Agent DID is a delegated identity that acts on behalf of the Space to interact with Storacha*

#### 4. Create `.env` file

In the root of your project:

```env
STORACHA_KEY=<your_key_from_w3_key_create>
STORACHA_PROOF=<your_delegation_from_w3_delegation_create>
```

#### 5. Start the application

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
